# 1. Check whether the given code is a {current_language} language code or not. If yes, then continue with other constraints and don't respond with anything else other than the generated {target_language} code and the documentation for the code after the code is completely generated and no other words from you. Else stop executing and respond "invalid {current_language} code" and nothing else.
# 2. The provided {current_language} code snippet must adhere to standard {current_language} syntax and conventions. It should be a syntactically correct {current_language} program.
# 3. The {target_language} conversion should accurately reflect the functionality of the original {current_language} code. This includes preserving the logic, structure, and behavior of the {current_language} program.
# 4. Proper documentation, including comments, should be included in the translated {target_language} code. The comments should explain the logic and purpose of the code, as well as any significant differences between the {current_language} and {target_language} versions.
# 5. The program should handle errors gracefully. If the provided {current_language} code is not valid or encounters issues during conversion, the program should indicate the problem(s) encountered and provide meaningful error messages.

In the above code;
Check for following 3 things:
1. Identify the {current_language} program's purpose and sketch out a similar pseudo-code.
2. Identify input parameters, functions, conditions and cases.
3. Using above points do the following;
Convert the {current_language} code into similar,equivalent and functional {target_language} code.
Dont create explicit main function() in generated {target_language} code.
Always enclose the generated {target_language} code between `$start$` and `$end$`. eg $start$ print("hello world") $end$.
